frenamer_tk
========
This is an alpha experiment on creating a OOP GUI version of frenamer using the TK toolkit and Perl v5.x.

frenamer_tk is a test bed for ideas to roll into frenamer and explore how a GUI version could work.
The goal to visually makes it easy to rename many files and folders using pattern matching (find and replace keywords 
or use regex), case translation, force or confirm changes, follow symbolic links, search recursively, 
and even only target files by file-extension.

As an experiment, it is feature incomplete, mostly optimizing bugs for certain features for MS Windows.

Requirements
========
This is cross platform program for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.
Perl v5.x and Perl TK

Currently works best on *nix systems.
